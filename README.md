# Backend Design Pattern



### Push 
The push design pattern is a software design pattern commonly used in the backend to enable efficient and real-time communication between components or systems. It allows for the automatic delivery of data or events from a sender to one or more receivers without the receivers explicitly requesting the data.
```
nodemon push/server.js
```

### Polling
checking for new data over a fixed interval of time by making API calls at regular intervals to the server. It is used to get real-time updates in applications. There are many applications that need real-time data and polling is a life savior for those applications.
```
nodemon polling/server.js
```

### Publisher/consumer
The publisher-subscriber pattern is a messaging pattern where publishers send messages to subscribers through a message broker or middleware.
The broker acts as an intermediary between the publishers and subscribers, allowing them to communicate without being aware of each otherâ€™s existence. This decoupling enables publishers to send messages without knowing who will receive them, and subscribers to receive messages without knowing who sent them.
```
nodemon publisher-consumer/server.js
```


### Server sent events
Server sent events(SSE) is a pushing technology that enables pushing notification/message/events from the server to the client(s) via HTTP connection.
```
nodemon server-sent-events/server.js
```
